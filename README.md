# **MetaSpace Drone Defense: Formal Integrity Layer**

**MetaSpace Drone Shield** is a high-integrity security framework designed to mitigate GPS Spoofing attacks in autonomous UAV systems. By utilizing **Formal Invariants** and **Logic-as-Hardware** synthesis, MetaSpace guarantees detection of spatial divergence within safety-critical latency bounds.

## **🛡️ The Innovation: Deterministic Integrity**

Unlike traditional probabilistic or AI-based models, MetaSpace treats security as a mathematical constraint.

* **Zero-Trust Navigation:** Real-time cross-verification of GPS data against Trusted Inertial Sensors (INS).
* **Shield Engaged Logic:** Immediate, deterministic isolation of compromised data streams.
* **Logic-as-Hardware:** Specifications compiled directly to FPGA gate-level logic, immune to OS-level exploits.

## **🚀 Quick Start**

### **1. Installation**

Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed:  
pip install -r requirements.txt

### **2. Launch Mission Control**

Run the tactical simulation server. This will open a local monitor window and start a telemetry broadcaster:  
python examples/spoofing\_simulation.py

### **3. Open Dashboard**

Open index.html in your browser to access the **MetaSpace Mission Control Dashboard** for real-time visual analysis.
